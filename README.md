# code-nightmare-snowflake

Working on making a chat client for the experience.  
Instead of an IRC-like client, this is intended to eventually be an 
improvement on the MU* architecture with support for other features such
as images and graphics.  

Yes, this is a novice project, but we all have to start somewhere.
